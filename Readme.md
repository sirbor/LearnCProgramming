# ðŸ“˜ C Programming Learning Curve

- A structured roadmap to master C programming from the ground up.

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner Level

- Start here if you're new to programming or C.
âœ… 1. Setup & Environment
- Installing GCC / Clang
- Setting up VS Code or Vim for C
- Writing and compiling your first C program
- Understanding the compilation process (gcc file.c -o file)
âœ… 2. Basic Syntax
- Structure of a C program
- main() function
- #include and standard libraries
- Variables and data types (int, float, char, etc.)
âœ… 3. Input/Output
- printf() and scanf()
- Escape sequences (\n, \t, etc.)
âœ… 4. Operators
- Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Bitwise
- Assignment and Unary operators
- Precedence and associativity
âœ… 5. Control Flow
- if, else if, else
- switch and case
- Loops: for, while, do-while
- break and continue
## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Level

- Build problem-solving and project-building skills.
âœ… 6. Functions
- Declaring and defining functions
- Return types and parameters
- Recursion
- Scope and storage classes (auto, static, extern, register)
âœ… 7. Arrays & Strings
- 1D and 2D arrays
- String handling with string.h
- Character arrays vs pointers to strings
âœ… 8. Pointers
- Pointer basics and memory addresses
- Pointer arithmetic
- Pointers and arrays
- Pointers to functions
- Pointers with strings and structs
âœ… 9. Dynamic Memory Allocation
- malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), free()
- Memory leaks and debugging
âœ… 10. Structures & Unions
- Defining and using struct and union
- Nested structures
- typedef for custom types
âœ… 11. File Handling
- Reading/writing text and binary files
- fopen(), fclose(), fread(), fwrite(), fprintf(), fscanf()
- Error handling in file operations
## ðŸ”´ Advanced Level

- Dive into complex system-level programming and performance.
âœ… 12. Advanced Pointers
- Double/triple pointers
- Function pointers
- Callbacks and pointer arrays
âœ… 13. Bit Manipulation
- Bitwise operations
- Flags and masks
- Efficient algorithm design using bits
âœ… 14. Preprocessor Directives
- Macros and #define
- Conditional compilation
- #ifdef, #ifndef, #pragma
âœ… 15. Linked Lists
- Singly, Doubly, and Circular linked lists
- Implementation and operations (insert, delete, traverse)
âœ… 16. Stacks & Queues
- Using arrays and linked lists to build stacks/queues
- Understanding LIFO and FIFO behavior
âœ… 17. Trees and Graphs (Intro)
- Binary trees, binary search trees (BST)
- Basic traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)
- Adjacency matrix & list representation of graphs
âœ… 18. Multifile Programs & Makefiles
- Splitting code into multiple .c and .h files
- Writing and using a Makefile for build automation
âœ… 19. Debugging & Testing
- Using gdb (GNU Debugger)
- Writing test cases
- Valgrind for memory leak detection
âœ… 20. System-Level Programming (Bonus)
- Working with system calls (fork, exec, pipe, etc.)
- Signal handling
- File descriptors and permissions
