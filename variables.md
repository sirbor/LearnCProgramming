### Variables

- Variables are fundamental components in programming that allow you to store and manage data.
- Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in your code.
- They can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, lists, and more.

- Here are some key points about variables:
  - **Declaration**: Variables must be declared before they can be used. This typically involves specifying a name and an initial value.
  - **Naming Conventions**: Variable names should be descriptive and follow specific naming conventions (e.g., no spaces, cannot start with a number).
  - **Scope**: Variables can have different scopes, meaning they can be accessible only within certain parts of your code (e.g., local vs. global variables).
  - **Data Types**: Variables can hold different data types, such as integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.
  - **Mutability**: Some data types are mutable (can be changed), while others are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
  - **Initialization**: Variables can be initialized with a value at the time of declaration or assigned a value later in the code.
  - **Reassignment**: Variables can be reassigned to new values, allowing for dynamic changes in your code.
  - **Best Practices**: Use meaningful names, avoid using reserved keywords, and keep variable names consistent with your coding style.
  - **Comments**: Use comments to explain the purpose of variables, especially if their names are not self-explanatory.
- **Examples**:

  - In C:

    ```c

    int age = 30; // Declaration and initialization
    float height = 5.9; // Another variable

    ```
